| #5 Fix legacy 311 parser and re-measure counts | Srikar | 2026-10-11 | in review | results below; unblocks #6, #10, #11 |

## Blocked
None.

## Risks raised
- Legacy storm groups cover only 6.9% of legacy requests (210,049 of 3,037,969), against about 15% in the pre-scoping check. The group list in `Data-Pipeline/config/legacy_storm_groups.csv` may be narrower than the first run's. Worth a look before #10 locks the unit.
- Tree requests leave the legacy files after Oct 2025 and flooding after Jul 2026 (moved to the new system). Legacy-only numbers for 2025 to 2026 undercount until #13 maps the new-system rows in.

## W1-5 results (2026-10-13)

Commands: `python Data-Pipeline/scripts/legacy_311.py` then `python Data-Pipeline/scripts/measure_311.py`. Data: legacy yearly files 2015 to 2026 from Analyze Boston, Logan GHCN-D (USW00014739). Last full day 2026-10-10.

### Row counts

Likely cause of the first-run loss: `open_dt` mixes whole seconds with 1 to 3 fractional digits. `pd.to_datetime` without a format infers it from the first row and turns the other variant into NaT. Parsing with `format="ISO8601"` fixes it, and the fixed parser loses no rows.

The first-run code is not in the repo, so the "inferred format" column below re-creates that bug rather than measuring the first run itself. It loses 1,474,743 of 3,037,969 rows (48.5%). That does not fully match the spec: the pre-scoping check counted 833,700 rows for Jan 2024 to early Oct 2026, close to the 840,543 legacy plus new-system rows now, so that run did not lose half its rows in that window. Treat "about a third" as unconfirmed.

| file | published | parsed | inferred format lost | now lost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2015 | 202,066 | 202,066 | 76,212 (37.7%) | 0 |
| 2016 | 210,483 | 210,483 | 87,317 (41.5%) | 0 |

| 2026 | 189,152 | 189,152 | 144,271 (76.3%) | 0 |

The new-system file has 68,542 records, matching the published count. It is not in the numbers below, since its categories need the #13 mapping.

### Sparsity

Storm-related legacy requests over 17 neighborhoods. "South Boston", "Allston", "Brighton", "Chestnut Hill" and "Mattapan" are folded into the city's combined names; "Boston" and blank (6,503 storm rows) count as no neighborhood.

| window | unit | cells | empty |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2015 to 2026 | neighborhood x day | 73,117 | 48.8% |
| 2015 to 2026 | neighborhood x day x group | 219,351 | 80.7% |
| 2024 to 2026 | neighborhood x day | 17,238 | 56.4% |
| 2024 to 2026 | neighborhood x day x group | 51,714 | 83.4% |

The first run's 77% is closest to neighborhood x day x group; with full rows it is 81 to 83%. Dropping the group split halves it.

### Storm ratios

Citywide daily counts on event days over the mean of control days in the same month. Control days within 3 days after an event are skipped, since cleanup requests keep the baseline high. Snow day: SNOW >= 25 mm, control SNOW = 0. Heavy rain: PRCP >= 25.4 mm, control PRCP < 2.5 mm. Heat: TMAX >= 32.2 C, control cooler Jun to Sep days.

Thresholds and controls are this re-measure's own; the first run's definitions are not recorded, so its ratios are shown for reference, not as a like-for-like comparison. New-system rows (Aug 2025 onward) are not included yet.

| check | event days | same day | next day | first run |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| snow_ice, snow days | 106 | 2.11x | 4.42x | 4.9x |
| flooding, heavy rain | 120 | 6.31x | 2.14x | 2.5x |
| tree, heavy rain | 120 | 1.43x | 1.26x | 1.7x |
| all requests, heat | 197 | 1.03x | 1.04x | 1.13x |

2015 to 2026 shown. For 2024 to 2026 (the first-run window): snow 1.45x / 4.36x, flooding 9.38x / 2.30x, tree 1.68x / 1.15x, heat 1.00x / 1.00x. Snow requests peak the day after the storm, flooding on the day. Heat gives almost no signal on total requests.
