# Boston Resilience Twin

Forecasting where Boston's 311 service demand will rise next, and checking that the forecast works fairly across neighborhoods.

IE7374 MLOps, Northeastern University, Fall 2026.

## What it does

- Forecasts each evening which Boston neighborhoods will see a surge in storm-related 311 requests the next day.
- Grades every forecast against the next day's 311 reports, tracks fairness across neighborhoods, detects drift, and retrains automatically.
- Core innovation: a fairness-aware retraining controller that decides when and how to retrain, compared against fixed schedules.
